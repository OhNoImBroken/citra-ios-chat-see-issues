# MAKEFILE TO BUILD CITRA DYLIB FOR IOS
I will warn you that this makefile was put together by a 0-year-old and as such is very messy. If you have a mac and xcode/command line tools are all set up, and it finds the SDK, it will build but have a linking error. I will have to write a tutorial on how to fix it but it's not pretty.
